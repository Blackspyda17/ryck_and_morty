# Rick & Morty App: A simple Rick & Morty Characters Catalog

Rick & Morty App is a [Rick & Morty](https://rickandmortyapi.com) characters catalog built as an iOS application developed using VIPER, GraphQL and adhering to modern development practices. It follows a modular architecture, implements the VIPER pattern, SwiftUI and Combine.

 # Technology Stack
The application is built using cutting-edge iOS technologies, encompassing: 

* Entirely coded in [Swift](https://www.swift.org)
* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)  for constructing user interfaces and app components
* [GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/) for handling network requests
* [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) for handling of asynchronous events by combining event-processing operators

# Architecture and Patterns
This iOS application is built using the VIPER architecture, which separates the app's logic into five distinct components: View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. This approach promotes a clear separation of concerns, ensuring that each component is highly decoupled and operates independently. The VIPER architecture enhances modularity, testability, and maintainability across the application.
